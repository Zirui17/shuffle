# Shuffle Simulator

This Streamlit app simulates a shuffle process and visualizes the results using Plotly.

## 🔧 How to Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

* If you are using vs code, you can use the ``Run and Debug`` to run directly.

## Result
**You can access the result at [This Streamlit Link](https://card-shuffling.streamlit.app/).**
  
*Note that you may need to reboot it to see it. And it can take a minute.*
